# Petrol-Price-Comparison
As part of our final year we needed to do a porject that required 450 hours over the trimerster. We did this trimester one 2020.
Our Project is developing a proof of concept with the AA as a client to provide feedback and fuel economy data. Note the api information does not work

This is a React Native app that makes REST requests to a Spring Java web service hosted on an AWS Elastic Beanstalk instance that accessed information stored in an AWS RDS MYSQL database.

This was both of our first time using git properly. Next time we will be able to better use Git. 

Relevant branches <br>
